# Task 1: Load and Explore Dataset ✅

Uses the classic Iris dataset (perfect for this assignment)
Loads data with proper error handling
Displays first 5 rows using .head()
Checks data types and structure
Identifies and handles missing values
Maps numerical species codes to readable names

# Task 2: Basic Data Analysis ✅

Computes comprehensive statistics using .describe()
Groups by species and calculates means
Creates correlation matrix
Identifies key patterns and findings

# Task 3: Data Visualization ✅
Creates 6 different visualizations:

Line Chart: Sepal length trends across samples
Bar Chart: Average petal length by species
Histogram: Distribution of sepal width
Scatter Plot: Sepal length vs petal length relationship
Box Plot: Petal width distribution comparison
Correlation Heatmap: Feature relationships

## Additional Features:

Advanced visualizations using seaborn
Comprehensive error handling
Professional plot customization (titles, labels, legends, colors)
Detailed insights and findings
Statistical analysis with key observations
Clean, well-commented code structure


# How to Run:

Save as either .py file or copy into Jupyter notebook .
Install required packages: pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn .
Run the script to see all analysis and visualizations .
